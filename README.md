This will run the program. the program opens up onto a loading srceen, after loading then opens a window to input player information.for every player text box wich takes in player name, two comboboxes

for help, "HELP" button and to start playing, "START". The game will only start after selecting atleast one player. If you select one player you play against the computer, otherwise a friend.

Once you press the "START" it will take you to the board game. The board game shows information on the players that have been inputed. Each player has a "ROW DICE" button. To play or basically make the shape move, you have to click "ROW DICE"
button. Once the first shape reaches position 100, they win the game.
